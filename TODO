Add to README:
 - have to download caffenet, googlenet, vgg caffemodels! (all renamed to "weights.caffemodel")


Celery
 - Have a celery worker built in, so dev-box works immediately
 - Show work queue progress in UI
 - Prevent performing operations before prereqs available
   - Or make that work

Rotations
 - Create extra rotations of seeds (and maybe PatchResponses?)
  - must "postrotate" so the center stays the same
    - need to make sure doesn't "catch the edge"
 - Express desired rotations in PatchSpec

Flesh out Dataset support:
 - UI for migrate to S3
 - Add an S3 bucket as a dataset
 - UI for removing PatchSpec, FeatureSpec associations
 - Failed s3 blob downloads shouldn't put 404 page into blob-n.jpg

Keyword UI
 - Add negative examples

Classifiers
 - Pick PatchQueries based on different FS predictions
 - Avoid picking the "same" patch modulo flips/rotations, location+scale
 - Advance to next round after more than one ActiveQuery
    - Both for more data, and for corroborating data

Features
  - add caffe features from
    - pretrained models
    - custom models
      
Mechanical Turk
 - publish HITs to answer a set of PatchQuerys

Organize Sass

Investigate pyflakes/pylint/pychecker for some static checks

PatchQuery points at patch. Should it also point at Feature?
 - No, it might be from two "good" predictions, not one great one

Public/private ownership of datasets, etc
 - Users should see public + their own

Test images against classifiers
 - User tests one image against all their classifiers
 - User runs some firehose against classifiers
 
Change scikit-image HoG feature to Pedro Felzenswalb HoG implementation
Make slide-in-feature-space extractor -- faster than slide-in-image-space
