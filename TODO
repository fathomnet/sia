Blobs lose url column, bu keep .url property
 (Blob class can map from locations to urls)
REMOVE, PROPERTY ADDED, UNTESTED

Many-to-many for Datsets and Blobs, so Blobs can be put "into"
Datasets, and can find dataset(s) of a Blob.

Patches lose location column they just specifies a "piece" of an image
Blob.

Patches get width and height, so that they need not be square.
 Should get rotation, too. Easiest to think of it as rotating the
 original image, and pulling out square pieces (that don't include the
 border). Small rotations are as important as 90 degree rotations.

 Should get flip too.  (flip up and flip side? ir express with rotation)

Patches lose dataset_id, as they have a blob which has dataset(s)

Add Feature model.  A FeatureSpec says how features should be
extracted from a Patch. A Feature object stores the info, and points
to the FeatureSpec to "explain" it

Fix zip import so that a Dataset is created, which is just a directory
full of image Blobs, which are associated to the named Dataset.

Web interface to PatchSpec, FeatureSpec
 - add/remove them from Dataset

Create the Patch and Feature objects for a Datatset when associations are made.

 Think about how to monitor progress of celery work, and either not
 allow UI to do things "too early", or make it end up working anyway,
 but waiting on the background jobs.

Make sass work

JS minification, combining

Investigate pyflakes/pylint/pychecker for some static checks

Make predictions and PatchQuery point to feature, not patch
