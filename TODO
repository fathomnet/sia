Express desired rotations in PatchSpec

Create extra rotations of seeds (and maybe PatchResponses?)

Flesh out Dataset support:
 - UI for migrate to S3
 - Add an S3 bucket as a dataset
 - UI for adding PatchSpec, FeatureSpec associations
 - UI for removing PatchSpec, FeatureSpec associations
 - Failed blob downloads shouldn't put 404 page into blob-n.jpg

Keyword UI
 - Add negative examples

Classifiers
 - Pick PatchQueries based on different FS predictions
 - Avoid picking the "same" patch modulo flips/rotations
 - Advance to next round after more than one ActiveQuery
    - Both for more data, and for corroborating data

Mechanical Turk

Monitor progress of celery work
 - Show progress in UI
 - Prevent performing operations before prereqs available
   - Or make that work

Organize Sass

Investigate pyflakes/pylint/pychecker for some static checks

PatchQuery points at patch. Should it also point at Feature?
 - No, it might be from two "good" predictions, not one great one

Public/private ownership of datasets, etc
 - Users should see public + their own

Test images against classifiers
 - User tests one image against all their classifiers
 - User runs some firehose against classifiers
