    <h2> Create a <strong>one-shot</strong> classifer in a few easy steps.</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="instr">
    <h3> Step 1: </h3>
    Upload your dataset using 'bin/dataset_ingestion.py' or use the testing
    dataset by running 'bin/forge.py'
    </br>
    <img width=800 src='images/dataset_main_ex.png' />
        </br>
        <img width=800 src='images/dataset_ex.png' />
  </div>

  <div class="instr">
    <h3> Step 2: </h3>
    Create a "Keyword". A Keyword in an an object that hold the initial
    example(s) of the concept you want to make classifier(s) for.
    Click on the Keyword Tab to begin making a Keyword.
    </br>
    This is the main page with all of the currently created keywords:
    </br>
    <img width=800 src='images/keyword_main_ex.png' />
    </br>
    <p>
    Click on "Create New Keyword" to start making a classifier for a new concept.
    Drag and drop one or more images that are <b>Positive Examples</b> of the concept.
    </p>
    <img width=800 src='images/keyword_new1.png' />
    <p>
      IMPORTANT: you must select the region of the image that contains
      the concept for the Keyword. If you want to use the whole image,
      make the selected region as big as allowed. Click and drag on
      the preview of the uploaded image to create the bounding
      box. Only square boxes are permitted at the moment. Please make an issue
      if you'd like rectangular selection.
      </p>
    <img width=800 src='images/keyword_new_bbox.png' />
    <p>
      Every selected bounding box will create a new example for this
      keyword. You can select multiple examples from the same image,
      e.g. you may want to use an image that has several dogs in it
      when creating a dog Keyword. The final examples for the Keyword
      are displayed at the bottom of the page. If incorrect regions
      are selected, simply click on the preview to have them removed.
    </p>
    <img width=800 src='images/keyword_new_wrong_selection.png' />
    <p>
      When you are satisfied with the selected example images, enter a
      name for the Keyword and click the "New Keyword" button. You
      will be redirect to a page that lists the example and all the
      classifiers made for this Keyword. This is where you can make a
      classifier for the new Keyword.
    </p>
    <img width=800 src='images/keyword_ex.png' />
  </div>

  <div class="instr">
    <h3> Step 3: </h3>
    <p>
      Create a classifier from the keyword against your dataset. On
      the profile page for a given Keyword, at the bottom of the page,
      there are options for creating a new classifier for that
      Keyword. Select the dataset you want to train on and the type of
      classifier you would like to create.
    </p>

    <p>
      After hitting the "Create Classifier" button, you will be
      redirected to the classifier update page, which will be empty at
      first. Creating a classifier will take different amounts of time depending
      on the size of the training and validation datasets.
      Please be patient and check back in on your new
      classifier after a short break. All of the created classifiers
      are listed under the "Train" tab.
      </p>


  </div>

  <div class="instr">
    <h3> Step 4: </h3>
    <p>
      In order to improve your classifier, you will have to update
      what the classifier thinks is correct and incorrect. If you
      click on the card for you new classifier on the Train page, you
      will be redirected to the query upate page for your
      classifier. At the top of this page, the most confident
      detections and the least confident detections of your classifier
      on the training set are shown. These examples will give you an
      indication of whether or not your new classifier has grasped the
      concept of your Keyword. If you scroll down, you will see the
      Query section of this page. On the left had side of the page are
      200 images that your classifier thinks might be the Keyword
      concept. Click on all of the image that are <b>Correct</b>. Any
      images in the left side column should be Negative examples, and
      the images in the right side column should be Postive
      examples. When you are done selecting images, click "Submit" at
      the top of the page. This will initiate retraining for your
      classifier. Please allow 10 mins-1 hour for this page to update.
    </p>
    <img width=800 src='images/query_page.png' />
    <p>
      Repeat this process until your classifier has learned what a
      keyword is. If the classifier is still failing after 5-7
      iterations, try restarting the classifier from scratch with different
      positive or negative initial examples, different training dataset, or
      adding different feature types to your training set. Please email
      use about persistent failure cases. Failures are learning experiences for us,
      so they are as important as successes.
